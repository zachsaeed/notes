    "Notice that unlike the first two implementations, there is no need to call file.close() when using with statement. The with statement itself ensures proper acquisition and release of resources.

    "\n",
    "### \\_\\_exit\\_\\_(self, exception_type, exception_value, traceback)\n",
    "Defines what the context manager should do after its block has been executed (or terminates). It can be used to handle exceptions, perform cleanup, or do something always done immediately after the action in the block. \n",
    "\n",
    "If the block executes successfully, exception_type, exception_value, and traceback will be None. Otherwise, you can choose to handle the exception or let the user handle it; if you want to handle it, make sure \\_\\_exit\\_\\_ returns True after all is said and done. If you don't want the exception to be handled by the context manager, just let it happen.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\_\\_enter\\_\\_ and \\_\\_exit\\_\\_ can be useful for specific classes that have well-defined and common behavior for setup and cleanup. You can also use these methods to create generic context managers that wrap other objects.\n",
