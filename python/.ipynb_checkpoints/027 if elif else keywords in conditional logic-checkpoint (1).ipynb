    "Python if else – conditional logic\n",
    "Well, so far we dealt with a static decision program. That means in our program we didn’t have to choose between any options. But what if we have to make our program behave differently in different conditions. That’s where we will use conditional logic. So conditional logic is how we can make a logical decision in a program.\n",

    "Suppose we want to write a program, that will determine whether a number is odd or even. If the number is odd, we want to print – “the number is odd” and if the number is even we want to print – “the number is even”. We can write this program using if keyword.\n",

    "Well, in the above scenario, the condition we have put, n%2, which has only two possible outcome. Either it’s zero or one. So here we can use else for the second condition. In that case we don’t have to write the second condition manually. We can write the first condition using a if and use else for other case.\n",
